            hey there! ðŸ‘‹ i'm a fullstack developer based in tangerang,
            indonesia, where i spend my days turning coffee into code and dreams
            into websites. after a decade of crushing it in e-commerce and
            digital marketing (trust me, i've seen enough marketing buzzwords to
            last a lifetime), i decided to plot-twist my career and dive
            headfirst into development.

            why the switch? well, imagine being really good at selling cakes,
            but suddenly realizing you want to be the master baker instead.
            that's me! armed with a computer science degree and fresh out of
            hacktiv8's fullstack javascript bootcamp (with a sweet 87.6 score -
            not that i'm counting ðŸ˜‰), i'm now crafting digital experiences that
            make both users and developers smile.

            you know how artists can stare at a blank canvas for hours? that's
            me with my code editor. to me, development is where art meets logic
            - it's like painting, but with semicolons and fewer paint stains on
            my clothes. whether it's crafting pixel-perfect frontends or
            architecting robust backend solutions, i'm all in.

            fun fact: i'm actually falling in love with coding for the second
            time. the first time was during my computer science days, but this
            time it's different - it's like reconnecting with an old flame who
            got way cooler over the years. these days, you'll find me coding
            until sunrise, not because i have to, but because i literally forget
            to check the time when i'm in the zone.

            coming from a background in e-commerce, branding, and digital
            marketing, i bring a unique perspective to development. i don't just
            build features - i build experiences that convert, engage, and
            delight users. think of it as combining the best of both worlds: the
            precision of a developer with the user-focused mindset of a
            marketer.

            currently, i'm channeling my passion into frontend engineering,
            where i can merge my eye for design with my love for clean,
            efficient code. the web development community has become my new
            home, and i couldn't be happier about it.
          </p>

            connect and build something awesome together!{" "}

            P.S. I promise to keep the marketing puns to a minimum in our
            collaboration... mostly ðŸ˜„
